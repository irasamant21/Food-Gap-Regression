# Predictive Modeling of Emergency Food Gaps in NYC

## 📝 Project Overview
Built a logistic regression model to predict neighborhoods at high risk of food insecurity during emergency situations using NYC open data.

## 📊 Goals
- Identify vulnerable areas in NYC using data science.
- Help city planners prepare for food distribution crises.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn (logistic regression)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (visualization)

## 🔍 Methodology
- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world food access data.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Built and evaluated a logistic regression model using precision, recall, F1-score.

## 📈 Key Results
- Achieved [Insert performance metrics here if available].
- Identified [Insert brief insight].
